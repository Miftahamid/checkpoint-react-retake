# Checkpoint: React

## Before You Begin

Every component has a test suite associated with it. **Before you begin
anything, run `npm install`.**

To run the tests in the terminal, run `npm test`. The tests will rerun every
time you save a file. When you start, all of the tests will be failing; your
goal is to make as many pass as you can in the hour provided.

> HINT: read the output of the failing tests.

## Instructions

You're going to build a simple Justice League Friends manager using React and
React Router. An initial set of Friends has been provided in `contacts.json` and
some CSS has been provided in `src/styles/index.css`.

Add Aquaman as a Friend:

```
{
  name: "Aquaman",
  email: "Atlantis@gmail.com",
  profile_picture: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Aquaman_Rebirth_1.png",
  super_power: "talks to fish"
}
```

### Setup

Inside `index.js`, import React Router and pass it to `ReactDOM.render()` as the
root component with `<App>` as a child component. We've imported the starter
contacts for you, pass these in to your `<App>` component as a prop, `contacts`.

### `<App>`

Your `<App>` component should accept `contacts` as a prop and use them to set
the initial state for your component. Setting props as initial state looks like
this:

```js
this.state = {
	// where contacts is the array of contacts from contacts.json
	contacts: this.props.contacts
}
```

Your `<App>` component should also render a div with a class name of `'App'`,
your `<Header>` component and then either your `<ContactList>` or `<NewContact>`
component, depending on the route. If the route is `"/"` then render the
`<ContactList>` component; if the route is `"/new-contact"` then render the
`<NewContact>` component;

### `<Header>`

Your `<Header>` component should render a `<header>` element with an `<h1>` and
a `<nav>` containing two React Router `<Link>`s, one to the homepage (`"/"`) and
the other to create a new contact (`"/new-contact"`).

### `<ContactList>`

Your `<ContactList>` component should render as the homepage of your app. It
should render a `<div>` with a class of `contact-list`. It should take
`contacts` as a prop and render a `<Contact>` component for each contact object
inside of the `contacts` prop.

### `<Contact>`

Your `<Contact>` component will render a single contact. It should contain an
outer `<div>` with a class of `contact` and include an `<img>` for the
profile_picture, `<h2>` for the name, `<h3>` for the email address, and `<h4>`
for the super_power.

### `<NewContact>`

Your `<NewContact>` component should render an `<h1>` with a text of
`New Contact` and a form with inputs for the `name`, `email`, `profile_picture`,
and `super_power`.

When submitted, you should save the new contact by updating your state inside of
`<App>` and direct the user back to the homepage/list of contacts.

## Rubric

- App component is defined and exported
- App component accepts the `contacts` json objects as a prop and the `contacts`
  json object is properly passed
- Router is defined and setup using the browser History API
- Router includes a route for the homepage (`"/"`) and for the new contact page
  (`"/new-contact"`)
- Header component is defined and exported
- Header component contains a title and two `<Link>`s, one to the homepage and
  the other to the new contact page
- ContactList component is defined and exported
- ContactList component iterates through the contacts, rendering a Contact
  component for each
- Contact component is defined and exported
- Contact component is rendering the image, name and email address of a contact
- NewContact is defined and exported
- NewContact contains a form that adds a new contact to the parent App component
  state
